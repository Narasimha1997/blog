Hello, World! (Just following the very old tradition in CS). I wrote this post under the broad daylight sun (Circa March, 2022), holding a cup of coffee in my left hand typing with my right hand. I just started this blog under the [protfolio website](https://Narasimha1997.github.io) to revive my long lost habit of writing. Previously I was one of the authors at [TowardsDataScience](https://medium.com/@narasimhaprasannahn) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/narasimha1997) where I wrote articles on AI, Machine Learning, Web Development and Sofware Engineering in general. After a long gap, I decided to write articles under my own website to keep myself away from temporary dopamine boosters such as **Likes** and **Comments**. I am here to explore my passion for writing. The opinions expressed here are my own and if you don't like it, please don't like it. :)
