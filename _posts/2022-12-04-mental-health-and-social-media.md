**Just writing this to spread awareness about mental health.**
Social media platforms may be inducing a whole bunch of [mass psychogenic illnesses](https://familydoctor.org/condition/mass-psychogenic-illness/) or MPI due to excessive addiction without our knowledge. 

## 1. So what is mass psychogenic illness?
This refers to a group psychological disorders that spread without any physical contact. It is more of a psychological thing than normal disease. You inherit these kinds of disorders naturally by being in close contact or watching someone who has that disease regularly and you will never know about it. In other words you inherit it from the environment you live in.

Some MPI illness due to TikTok / Instagram reels are - 

1. Tics
2. Inherited Attention deficiency
3. Assumed (inherited) depression

I have curated the list of resources from around the web that explains these issues in depth.

## 2. Tics
Have you ever seen a teenager or an adolescent who is acting weird and uncontrollably moving their hands/legs in social gatherings while talking, walking or while doing normal things? You may think it is overacting. But most of them are suffering from Tics. It is a neurological condition where your nervous system has hyperactive control or lack of control over your body parts. The scary thing - this is a **mass psychogenic illness**. It has been found that people who are addicted to TikTok/ reels are more vulnerable to this disease because they constantly watch and try to be like those influencers who also have tics.

## 3. Induced/Assumed ADHD
ADHD is a psychological disease, but can be inherited due to excessive addiction to TikTok and Instagram reels. How many of us can give complete attention to videos that are more than 5 mins? Very few of us, because most of us lack attention and get carried away by other things. Ignore videos, same applies to many day to day things as well. People who are constantly watching reels that are few seconds in length are wiring their brains for less attention span. This is a serious thing, excess ADHD can damage your relationships and even sometimes lead to tragedies in real world. And even more funny, #ADHD hashtags are most viewed on TikTok and pushed lot of people into believing that they have ADHD.

## 4. Inherited depression
Lot of teens are addicted to Billie Eilish because they can relate her songs to what is happening in their life, is this true? May not be. She indirectly induce in you such mental state, it gets even worse as you watch more of her content. Thus you inherited an unknown disease that you never had. Same applies to many influencers as well, when they speak of their past, or their Bipolar syndrome or ADHD, they are actually triggering a sense of doubt in the minds of their viewers. These platforms are spreading negativity like never before. And platforms like TikTok and Instagram reels were found to spread body negativity, inferiority complex which can lead to depression.
