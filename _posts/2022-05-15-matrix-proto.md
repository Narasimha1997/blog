Recently, at Null community, we had a conversation with Bill Ottman - founder and CEO of Minds Inc, a decentralized social media platform that respects freedom of speech, privacy and decentralized governance. During our conversation, Bill spoke about Matrix protocol and how it has enabled Minds to build a completely democratic, decentralized messages store where people have complete shared ownership of their conversations. This made me interested in Matrix and pushed me into the endeavor of digging deep into the technical aspects of the protocol. In this post, I am trying to summarize what I read about Matrix over past few days.
