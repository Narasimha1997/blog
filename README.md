# blog
Source tree of my blog

1. Checkout [gh-pages](https://github.com/Narasimha1997/blog/tree/gh-pages) branch to get the codebase.
2. Most of the code used to build this blog are taken from [tocttou/hacker-blog](https://github.com/tocttou/hacker-blog) and I would give the full credits of this blog design to [tocttou](https://github.com/tocttou) for designing an awesome boiler plate and helping many people to easily get started with their own blog in few simple steps.
